  Message=**Managed Debugging Assistant 'ContextSwitchDeadlock' :** 'The CLR has been 
  unable to transition from COM context 0x5f1890 to COM context 0x5f1720 for 60 seconds. 
  The thread that owns the destination context/apartment is most likely either doing a non 
  pumping wait or processing a very long running operation without pumping Windows 
  messages. This situation generally has a negative performance impact and may even lead 
  to the application becoming non responsive or memory usage accumulating continually over 
  time. To avoid this problem, all single threaded apartment (STA) threads should use 
  pumping wait primitives (such as CoWaitForMultipleHandles) and routinely pump messages
  during long running operations.'
